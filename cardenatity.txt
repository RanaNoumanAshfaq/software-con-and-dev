Here's an explanation of the relationships between the classes in the **Furniture Management System (FMS)** and their cardinality (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.):

### 1. **Furniture and InventoryManager**
   - **Relationship**: One-to-Many
   - **Explanation**: An `InventoryManager` manages multiple `Furniture` items in the store's inventory.
   - **Cardinality**: One `InventoryManager` manages multiple `Furniture` objects, but each `Furniture` item belongs to a single inventory managed by one `InventoryManager`.

### 2. **Order and Customer**
   - **Relationship**: Many-to-One
   - **Explanation**: Each `Order` is placed by a `Customer`, and a customer can place multiple orders over time. An order belongs to a single customer.
   - **Cardinality**: Many `Order` objects belong to one `Customer`.

### 3. **Order and Furniture**
   - **Relationship**: Many-to-Many
   - **Explanation**: An `Order` can include multiple `Furniture` items, and a single `Furniture` item can be part of multiple orders.
   - **Cardinality**: Many `Order` objects contain many `Furniture` objects. To represent this, a linking class (like `OrderItem`) could be used to handle this many-to-many relationship in implementation.

### 4. **Customer and ShoppingCart**
   - **Relationship**: One-to-One
   - **Explanation**: Each `Customer` has one `ShoppingCart`, and each `ShoppingCart` belongs to only one customer.
   - **Cardinality**: One `Customer` has one `ShoppingCart`.

### 5. **ShoppingCart and Furniture**
   - **Relationship**: Many-to-Many
   - **Explanation**: A `ShoppingCart` can contain multiple `Furniture` items, and a single `Furniture` item can be in multiple shopping carts (for different customers).
   - **Cardinality**: Many `ShoppingCart` objects contain many `Furniture` items. Similar to the `Order` and `Furniture` relationship, this can be implemented via a linking class.

### 6. **SalesStaff and Order**
   - **Relationship**: One-to-Many
   - **Explanation**: Each `SalesStaff` member creates and manages multiple `Order` objects. An order is handled by one sales staff member.
   - **Cardinality**: One `SalesStaff` member handles many `Order` objects.

### 7. **StoreManagement and Report**
   - **Relationship**: One-to-Many
   - **Explanation**: `StoreManagement` can generate multiple `Report` objects (for sales, inventory, etc.).
   - **Cardinality**: One `StoreManagement` object generates many `Report` objects.

### 8. **FinanceOfficer and Report**
   - **Relationship**: One-to-Many
   - **Explanation**: A `FinanceOfficer` generates financial `Report` objects to track expenses, sales data, etc.
   - **Cardinality**: One `FinanceOfficer` generates multiple `Report` objects.

### 9. **Order and Payment**
   - **Relationship**: One-to-One
   - **Explanation**: Each `Order` has one associated `Payment`. The payment is processed for a single order.
   - **Cardinality**: One `Order` has one `Payment`, and each `Payment` is tied to one `Order`.

### Cardinality Summary:
- **One-to-Many**:
  - `InventoryManager` -> `Furniture`
  - `SalesStaff` -> `Order`
  - `StoreManagement` -> `Report`
  - `FinanceOfficer` -> `Report`

- **Many-to-One**:
  - `Order` -> `Customer`

- **Many-to-Many**:
  - `Order` <-> `Furniture`
  - `ShoppingCart` <-> `Furniture`

- **One-to-One**:
  - `Customer` -> `ShoppingCart`
  - `Order` -> `Payment`

2. Inventory Class
Attributes:
inventoryID: Unique identifier for the inventory record.
stockLevel: Current stock level of all furniture items.
lastUpdated: Date and time when the inventory was last updated.
furniture: List of Furniture items currently in inventory.
Relationships:
Inventory -> Furniture (One-to-Many): An Inventory can track multiple Furniture items, but each item belongs to only one inventory record.
Inventory -> InventoryManager (One-to-One): The InventoryManager oversees the Inventory. Each InventoryManager is responsible for one inventory.
Inventory -> Sales (One-to-Many): Each Inventory can be associated with multiple Sales records, as sales will reduce the stock level.In cases of **many-to-many relationships** (e.g., `Order` and `Furniture` or `ShoppingCart` and `Furniture`), these can be represented by an intermediary table (like `OrderItem`) to associate multiple items with multiple orders.
